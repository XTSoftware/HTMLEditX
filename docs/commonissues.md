## Common Issues

### 1. The program says I'm missing some DLL file. How do I fix this?
Download the latest .NET Framework from [Microsoft's official website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer)) and try again.

### 2. The preview pane isn't working!
Check the directory C:/Users/Public exists on your computer. If it does, create a file called "preview.html" and then it should work. If you don't have this folder, try checking on [this Microsoft Answers page](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/cuserspublic-disappeared/a93388e5-1fa2-4b4a-8848-496d840b4ff8)  or [this Tech Support Forum post.](https://www.techsupportforum.com/threads/solved-cant-find-c-users-public-folders.689658/)
